As Head Architect at Salesforce, Jan will take us through Hyper’s incredible transition from an academic project to an enterprise-grade database engine. Expect fascinating insights into the challenges, optimizations, and technical marvels that keep Hyper at the forefront of analytical database performance. We are excited to finally host the Hyper team for this special occasion!
