    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
        In modern application development, engineers frequently encounter the challenge of synchronizing database transactions with messaging activities. Ensuring that a message is sent only when a database transaction is successfully committed, and vice versa, is crucial. This synchronization is essential for scenarios like updating order statuses while triggering payments, or modifying bookings and sending confirmation emails. This talk will explore techniques to achieve atomicity and consistency between message queues and databases. We will delve into various approaches, considerations, and real-world experiences, highlighting different methods along with their advantages and disadvantages. Practical use cases from actual projects will be provided to illustrate the effective application of each approach.

    <h3>Talk info</h3>

    <p>
        Ocient is a data analytics software solutions company that enables all-the-time, compute-intensive analysis of large, complex datasets while optimizing for performance, cost, and energy efficiency. The Ocient Hyperscale Data Warehouse is designed from the ground up for highly efficient data processing and analysis capabilities, machine learning, ELT, and more. In this talk, we will discuss the major architectural concepts pioneered by Ocient, including its Compute Adjacent Storage Architecture (CASA), resource-aligned parallelism, and I/O pushdown. We'll also dive deeper into how Ocient manages to reduce the system footprint, cost, and energy consumption of always-on, compute-intensive workloads.
