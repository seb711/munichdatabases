    <h2>Our Speakers</h2>
    
    <h3>Yingjun Wu, Founder & CEO at RisingWave Labs</h3>
    <p>
        Yingjun Wu is the founder and CEO of RisingWave Labs, a company developing a distributed SQL database designed for stream processing and real-time analytics. With over a decade of experience in the field, Yingjun has previously worked as a software engineer on the Amazon Redshift team at AWS and as a researcher at IBM's Almaden Research Center. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the National University of Singapore and was a visiting Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University.

    <p><strong>Talk:</strong> Building a Real-Time Lakehouse on Iceberg (Without Losing Your Mind)</p>
    <p>
        Everyone makes streaming sound simple - until you try bolting it onto your batch pipeline and it blows up. This talk skips the marketing gloss and gets into the real work: how to make batch and streaming actually play nice. I'll walk through the essentials, then get into the messy parts - compaction, primary key updates, exactly-once delivery, and keeping your compute bill from spiraling. You'll learn how to plug RisingWave into your existing stack and get real-time results without rewriting everything. It's based on what we've seen in production - real problems, real fixes, no buzzwords.

    <h3>Georg Kreuzmayr, Software Engineer at Firebolt</h3>
    <p>
        Georg Kreuzmayr is a software engineer at Firebolt, focusing on high-performance data processing and distributed systems. He is also the founder of TUMuchData. Georg pursued his bachelor's and master's degrees at TUM, where he specialized in database systems.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Talk:</strong> The Story of When Fire(bolt) Meets Ice(berg)</p>
    <p>
        In this talk, we take a look under the hood of Firebolt and dive into the challenges we had to solve to bring a free-to-use production-grade data warehouse to the market. Furthermore, you will learn about our efforts to support high-performance, low-latency analytics on the lakehouse architecture.
