      Streaming Analytics in the Cloud: Not Your Father's Streaming SQL Engine!

      How do you query streaming data in real-time? Use streaming SQL engine! It sounds straightforward, right? However, when it comes to handling schema changes, dynamic scaling, high availability, and complex streaming joins, the challenges become apparent. The root cause often lies in how internal states are managed in these systems.
      
      In this talk, Yingjun will introduce RisingWave, a scalable streaming database that utilizes S3 as its primary storage. By decoupling compute from storage, RisingWave enables independent scaling of these components. From underlying technology to real-world scenarios, Yingjun will illustrate how RisingWave supports heavy traffic workloads in enterprise-grade production environments.     </p>
