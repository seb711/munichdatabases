    <h3>Talk Info</h3>

    <p>
        This talk provides an overview of our modern database system, which enables processing and analyzing data in a single system. We explore the evolution of DBMSs from their traditional design to our modern data processing system, which efficiently manages and queries data. We take a technological deep dive into the core query execution engine behind CedarDBs and show fun examples that leverage this execution engine for interesting insights.
