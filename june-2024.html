    <h1>June 11, 2024 Talks</h1>

    <p>
        We are pleased to have Goetz Graefe and Maksim Sobolevskiy speak, 
        and glad to have JetBrains as a
        partner for the venue.

    <h2>Instant Repair, Restart, Restore, Reboot, and Failover - Advances in Log-Based Database Recovery</h2>

    <p>
        Goetz Graefe has published surveys on database concurrency control, logging and recovery, indexing, sorting, query execution, and query optimization. Since graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison as an MS in 1984 and a PhD in 1987 with a thesis on extensible database query optimization in EXODUS, he invented the Exchange operator for parallel query execution as well as the Volcano and Cascades frameworks for database query optimization, watched as research and industry widely copied and adopted these designs, received an ACM SIGMOD Test of Time award and the inaugural IEEE ICDE Influential Paper award for these inventions, served as the query processing architect of Microsoft SQL Server in its formative years, researched robust query performance, concurrency control, logging, and instant recovery as an HP Fellow at HP Labs, shared in an ACM Software Systems award, and received the 2017 ACM SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations award. He is now the Technical Lead of the F1 Query system widely used within Google.    </p>

        Instant repair, restart, restore, reboot, and failover - advances in log-based database recovery: The three classic failure modes considered in database recovery are transaction, system, and media failure. The standard recovery techniques by rollback, three-phase restart, and many-phase restore. We added a fourth failure mode, single-page failure, with recovery by single-page repair. Using on-demand single-transaction rollback and single-page repair, restart and restore after system or media failure can become apparently instant. Failover within a cluster or data center as well as reboot of an in-memory database server can recover like a combined media and system failure, also with apparently instant recovery.    </p>

    <h3>Talk Info</h3>

    <p>
      In this live demo, Maksim will showcase DataGrip’s features for effective SQL query execution and data management. From speeding up simple statements to complex tasks like custom data exports and using VCS with databases, Maksim will demonstrate how DataGrip enhances productivity for database developers.
