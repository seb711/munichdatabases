    <h1>Modern Data Systems: High-Performance Query Engines for Distributed and Cloud-Native Architectures</h1>
    <p>
        Fresh off our June meetup, we're back with another session in July! Join us for a deep dive into modern data systems featuring high-performance query engines for distributed and cloud-native architectures. SAP will present the HANA Native Query Engine for lakehouse analytics, while PingCAP will explore TiDB, a distributed SQL database built for scalability and real-time workloads.

    <h3>Paul R. Willems & Daniel Ritter, SAP</h3>
    <p><strong>The HANA Native Query Engine for Lakehouse Systems</strong></p>
    <p>
        Modern enterprise systems increasingly store data in lakes for cost and scalability, using columnar formats like Parquet and open table formats like Iceberg or Delta. This shift challenges traditional databases to deliver high performance on complex analytical queries over remote data. In this talk, we present SQL-on-Files (SoF), an adaptation of the HANA Cloud Database Engine for efficient file-based processing in SAP's Business Data Cloud. We discuss architectural choices like pushdown vs. direct access, highlight design decisions around execution, optimization, and caching, and show how SoF delivers performance gains on analytical workloads in a new warehouse benchmark.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Daniel van Eeden, PingCAP</h3>
    <p><strong>TiDB under the hood</strong></p>
    <p>
        This talk introduces TiDB and the concept of distributed databases, which store parts of a database across multiple machines for scalability and reliability. Developed by PingCAP, TiDB is built using open-source components and features a robust architecture that includes TiKV, RocksDB, Raft, PD, TSO, and TiFlash. The agenda covers the history of TiDB, its core building blocks, and a concluding overview of its capabilities.
